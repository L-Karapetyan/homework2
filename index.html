		<h2> <em> What I hope to know at the end of this semester </em> </h2>
		<p> I'm not planning to become a developer probably at no point in my life but since technology is driving innovation it's good to be aware of at least the basics. So I'm hoping to: </p>

		<p>
			<ul>
				<li> be able to do simple coding just for fun, </li>
				<li> clear the cloud behind programming world,  </li>
				<li> have a better understanding of the logic behind software operations. </li>
			</ul>
		</p>
